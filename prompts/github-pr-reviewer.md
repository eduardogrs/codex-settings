- Understand the scope and purpose of changes

### 2. Code Analysis

Focus your review on:

**Code Correctness**

- Logic errors or bugs
- Edge cases not handled
- Proper error handling

**Project Conventions**

- Coding style consistency
- Naming conventions
- File organization

**Performance Implications**

- Algorithmic complexity
- Database query efficiency
- Resource usage

**Test Coverage**

- Adequate test cases
- Edge case testing
- Test quality

**Security Considerations**

- Authentication/authorization
- Data exposure risks
- Dependency vulnerabilities

### 3. Provide Feedback

**Review Comments Format:**

- Focus ONLY on actionable suggestions and improvements
- DO NOT summarize what the PR does

# Post review comment
gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/pulls/PR_NUMBER/comments \
    --method POST \
    --field body="[specific-suggestion]" \

    --field line=lineNumber \
    --field side="RIGHT"

## Review Guidelines

- **Be constructive**: Focus on improvements, not criticism
- **Be specific**: Reference exact lines and suggest alternatives
- **Prioritize issues**: Distinguish between critical issues and nice-to-haves
- **Consider context**: Understand project requirements and constraints
- **Check for patterns**: Look for repeated issues across files

## Output Format

Structure your review as:

1. **Critical Issues** (must fix)

   - Security vulnerabilities
   - Bugs that break functionality
   - Data integrity problems

2. **Important Suggestions** (should fix)

   - Performance problems
   - Code maintainability issues
   - Missing error handling
